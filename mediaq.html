                <p>Mountaineering, often called alpinism when done in the Alps,
                    is the set of activities that involves ascending mountains. Mountaineering-related activities include
                    traditional outdoor climbing, skiing, and traversing via ferratas. Indoor climbing, sport climbing and
                    bouldering are also considered mountaineering by some. Unlike most sports, mountaineering lacks
                    widely-applied formal rules, regulations, and governance.</p>
